A copy of my portfolio site https://perryharlock.co.uk  

The npm install will install grunt, autoprefixer, uglify..and much much more!  

Grunt will monitor less and js files and compile and minify them when they change as well as on initial run.

1 Install:  
`npm install`

2 Monitor files 
`npm start`  

3 In VSCode use the live server extension to start a server and see the website
(if you right click on the index.html file there is an option to open with live server)

NOTE
====

- Minimal version bootstrap with grid, utilities, responsive utilities and scaffolding
- Using 24 column bootstrap grid
- Larger screen breakpoint added for grid at 1310px
- All Less/CSS is prefixed and minimised on compilation
