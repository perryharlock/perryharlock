The npm install will install grunt, autoprefixer, uglify, liver-server..and much much more!  

Grunt will monitor less and js files and compile and minify them when they change as well as on initial run.

1 Install:  
`npm install`

2 Monitor files and start live-server  
`npm start`  

Go to http://localhost:8080/

- Using 24 column bootstrap grid
- Larger screen breakpoint added for grid at 1310px
